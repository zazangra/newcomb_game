# Newcomb_game
Attempt to let AI play a Newcomb's problem. This is a simple and trivial implementation of AI using Gym and a Q-learning algorithm.

This project is part of an exam at Unito: it is definetly not a usable source for the Newcomb's problem and AI

This is one of my first projects in Python: I'm a noob, please suggest but not blame!

## The game

Newcomb's problem game is defined at gym-basic/gim_basic/envs/basic_env.py

My computation of Newcomb's problem assumes a perfectly omniscent predictor. Any pulls for implementing a more articulated (with probabilities?) or a
better definition are welcome!!

Btw, I don't think that there exist a radical different way to write it (I'll be happy to be proved wrong!)
